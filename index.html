            IBM was founded in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), a holding company of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring systems. It was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924 and soon became the leading manufacturer of punch-card tabulating systems. During the 1960s and 1970s, the IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360 and its successors, was the world's dominant computing platform, with the company producing 80 percent of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of computers worldwide.[11] Embracing both business and scientific computing, System/360 was the first family of computers designed to cover a complete range of applications from small to large.[12]

As of 2016, these offerings fall into the categories of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, commerce, data and analytics, Internet of things (IoT),[141] IT infrastructure, mobile, digital workplace[142] and cybersecurity.[143]</p>

        <p>In January 2019, IBM introduced its first commercial quantum computer: IBM Q System One.[150] In March 2020, it was announced that IBM would build Europe's first quantum computer in Ehningen, Germany. The center, operated by the Fraunhofer Society, was opened in 2024.[151][152][153]</p>

        <img src="./IBM_ads_at_JFK.jpg" alt="" align="right">

        <p style="color: darkkhaki;">IBM is nicknamed Big Blue partly because of its blue logo and color scheme,[184][185] and also in reference to its former de facto dress code of white shirts with blue suits.[184][186] The company logo has undergone several changes over the years, with its current "8-bar" logo designed in 1972 by graphic designer Paul Rand.[187] It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period photocopiers did not render narrow (as opposed to tall) stripes well. Aside from the logo, IBM used Helvetica as a corporate typeface for 50 years, until it was replaced in 2017 by the custom-designed IBM Plex.</p>
